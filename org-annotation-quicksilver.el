;;; org-annotation-quicksilver --- OS X only. Allows creation of org
;;; notes from other applications via Quicksilver and remember-mode.
;;
;; Author: Christopher Suckling: suckling AT gmail DOT com
;;
;; Version: 0.624
;;
;;; Commentary
;; 
;; Opens a *remember* buffer from any AppleScript enabled application,
;; linking to the open document and, were possible, setting the initial
;; content of the *remember* buffer to the document's selected
;; text. Features dynamic selection of remember templates from
;; Quicksilver and transparant creation of org notes without switching
;; focus from the source application.
;;
;; This file is an extended verison of org-annotation-helper.el by
;; [bzg] and [dmg]. It incorporates slightly modified functions from
;; org-remember.el by Carsten Dominik.
;;
;;; Requirements
;;
;; OS X 10.5 (untested on previous versions, but should work) 
;;
;; org-mode
;; remember-mode 
;;
;; org-annotation-quicksilver helper AppleScripts (included in 
;; this archive): 
;; org-link.scpt 
;; org-note.scpt
;; org-remember.scpt 
;; Optional: org-mairix-display.scpt and org-mairix-link.sh (if this 
;; package is not already obscure enough, if you also happen to use
;; mutt in a Termial.app window and use mairix to index your maildir
;; folders, then this may be useful)
;;
;; Quicksilver (http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-alchemy/) 
;;
;;; Installation
;;
;; Copy this file to your load path and byte compile.
;;
;; Add 
;;
;; (require 'org-annotation-quicksilver) 
;;
;; to your .emacs.
;;
;; Please see org-annotation-quicksilver.org for full installation
;; instructions for the helper AppleScripts and *remember* buffer
;; templates.
