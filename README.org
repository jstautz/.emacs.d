* Jeff's Emacs config 

I'm using a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] approach to organize my Emacs configuration. 

Instead of peppering my elisp with pithy comments, I've gone the other way: I use org-mode outlines to thoroughly document my thinking, and I sprinkle this explanation with hunks of elisp.

My init.el uses org-babel to extract these code blocks from my .org documentation files and load my configuration. Neat, huh?

Read [[https://github.com/jstautz/.emacs.d/blob/master/emacs-init.org][my base configuration here]].

I use org-mode a hell of a lot, and my org setup is a little convoluted. I've pulled the configuration for it into [[https://github.com/jstautz/.emacs.d/blob/master/org-mode-init.org][a separate file here]].

** Disclaimers

Fair warning:

- This is a perpetual work in progress.
- No attempts have been made to make this setup portable. It's full of weird environment idiosyncracies, and there are probably a bunch of undocumented dependencies.
- Only tested with Emacs 25.3.1 on OS X
- Your mileage, as they say, may vary.
- I'm not responsible if any of this blows up on you.
