* My emacs config 

Contains dozens of ideas stolen from various places around the internet, hundreds of tiny tweaks and fiddles, and a
few hand-written hunks of elisp of which I am not entirely proud.

Makes heavy use of use-package, which will theoretically install any missing packages on startup. In practice, I've actually dumped packaged into this repo in the /elpa directory, so that my whole environment is checked in to a known working state.

*** Disclaimers
- Only tested with Emacs 25.3.1 on OS X
- No attempts have been made to make this setup portable. It's full of weird environment idiosyncracies.
- Your mileage, as they say, may vary.
- A perpetual work in progress.
