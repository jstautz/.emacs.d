* Introduction

My emacs config. 

*** Disclaimers
- Requires Emacs 24. Only tested on Mac OS X
- Requires ns-toggle-fullscreen patch found here: https://gist.github.com/1397155
- No attempts have been made to make this setup portable. It's probably full of weird environment idiosyncracies.
- A perpetual work in progress, currently undergoing some heavy refactoring.
